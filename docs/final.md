## Project Overview
Our web application helps people stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes a news feed featuring recent articles about COVID-19 from a variety of sources. It also features a timeline showing the increases in cases in various selectable states on a map of the United States. This timeline also features articles about actions the governments of these states have taken and when.

## User Interface

A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.

Sheikh Noohery: It was a bit stressful to work on the project from home due to COVID-19. However, I learned a lot from working on the project with my teammates. First, I learned how to use GitHub properly using the terminal. I have never used git before so that part of the experience was new for me. I also learned how to use bootstrap and will be using it every time I make an HTML page. The most difficult part for me and my teammates was the back-end. I wish we spent more time in class understanding how the different databases are manipulated with typescript. It was challenging to take what we learned in the class exercises and apply them to our database. Nevertheless, I can still create a basic MongoDB database, servers, and deploy apps on Heroku. Even though I found this project challenging, I learned a lot from working on it with Julia and Griffin.
