## Project Overview
Our web application helps people stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes a news feed featuring recent articles about COVID-19 from a variety of sources. It also features a timeline showing the increases in cases in various selectable states on a map of the United States. This timeline also features articles about actions the governments of these states have taken and when.

## User Interface

A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.
APIs: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s API

## Database

A final up-to-date representation of your database including a brief description of each of the entities in your data model and their relationships if any.
URL Routes/Mappings: A final up-to-date table of all the URL routes that your application supports and a short description of what those routes are used for. You should also indicate any authentication and permissions on those routes.
Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

## Division of Labor

A breakdown of the division of labor for each team member — that is, saying who did what, for the entire project. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.

Julia Peterson: server.ts, package.json, database.ts, secrets.json

Robert Powell: final.md, database.ts.

Sheikh Noohery: final.md, server.ts, database.ts
