## Innovative Idea 
As of March 30, 2020, over 30,000 people have died from confirmed cases of COVID-19. The pandemic has been affecting people's livelihoods around the world in severe ways. Suitably, there are multiple websites from various sources that are informing people with the latest news and scientific discoveries on COVID-19. For example, the [World Health Organization website](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) displays the global statistics of coronavirus and reports how countries around the world are dealing with the pandemic. On a national scale, there are websites like the [CDC's Coronavirus Webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) that provide information for people in residing within respective countries. There are also numerous webpages from cities that provide the same information on a local scale.  
  
Our goal for this project is to create a website that collects coronavirus news and information from official sources and presents them in one place. Our focus will primarily be on the United States. Additionally, we are using news articles to create a timeline of when different states in the United States started to take this pandemic seriously. For example, what was the number of affected cases when Massachusetts declared an emergency? 

## Important Components
It will have a news feed featuring recent articles about COVID-19 from a variety of sources.  It will also feature a timeline showing the increases in cases in various selectable states on a map of the United States.  This timeline will also feature articles about actions the governments of these states have taken and when.
