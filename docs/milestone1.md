## Data Interactions  
Please outline the interactions between your users and the data. If your idea remains the same as what you submitted for Milestone 0, this will be the same. If not, please update this document with a bulleted list of the data interactions. This information will all be in docs/milestone1.md  

## Wireframes  
Your team must collaboratively design and draw wireframes for your proposed website. The wireframes can be hand drawn or made using a program. Use these wireframes in tandem with your written explanation above to clearly demonstrate the vision for your application to the course staff. Please include your wireframes in the document you will make for this milestone called docs/milestone1.md

## HTML and CSS  
Your team must also come up with a polished web interface with HTML and CSS code. We are requiring that you use Bootstrap for the layout of your HTML elements. You can also include some Javascript code to polish up some animations and user interaction. Please include a screenshot of your HTML page inside your milestone Markdown file docs/milestone1.md
